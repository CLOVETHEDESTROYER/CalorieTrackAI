# OpenAI Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you integrate OpenAI's GPT API with your CalTrack AI app for intelligent meal analysis and suggestions.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Give it a name like "CalTrack AI"
5. Copy your API key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Configure Your App

1. Open `Info.plist` in your Xcode project
2. Find the `OPENAI_API_KEY` entry
3. Replace `your-openai-api-key-here` with your actual API key

```xml
<key>OPENAI_API_KEY</key>
<string>sk-your-actual-api-key-here</string>
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: For production apps, use a more secure method to store API keys (like Keychain or environment variables).

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Build and run your app
2. Navigate to the "AI Assistant" tab
3. Try the meal analysis feature:
   - Enter: "Grilled chicken breast with steamed broccoli and brown rice"
   - Tap "Analyze with AI"
   - Check if you get nutrition estimates

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Token Usage

- **GPT-4o-mini**: Cost-effective model optimized for nutrition tasks
- **Average Cost**: ~$0.01-0.03 per analysis
- **Monthly Estimate**: $5-15 for regular use

### Cost-Saving Tips

1. Use the Quick Analysis for simple meals
2. Batch multiple food items in one description
3. Set up usage limits in OpenAI dashboard
4. Monitor usage in OpenAI billing section

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Prompts

You can modify the system prompts in `OpenAIService.swift`:

- `mealAnalysisSystemPrompt`: For meal analysis accuracy
- `mealSuggestionSystemPrompt`: For meal planning style
- `foodRecognitionSystemPrompt`: For food identification

### Model Selection

Change the model in `OpenAIService.swift`:

```swift
private let model = "gpt-4o-mini" // Current default
// Alternatives:
// "gpt-4o" - More accurate but more expensive
// "gpt-3.5-turbo" - Faster but less accurate
```

### Temperature Settings

Adjust creativity vs consistency:

```swift
temperature: 0.3 // Current setting (more consistent)
// 0.0 - Very consistent, less creative
// 0.7 - More creative, less consistent
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid API Key" Error**

   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check if you have credits in your OpenAI account
   - Ensure the key has proper permissions

2. **Network Errors**

   - Check internet connection
   - Verify OpenAI API status
   - Try again after a few seconds

3. **Poor Analysis Results**

   - Be more specific in meal descriptions
   - Include quantities when possible
   - Try different wording

4. **API Rate Limits**
   - OpenAI has rate limits for API calls
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding this to `OpenAIService.swift`:

```swift
private func logRequest(_ prompt: String) {
    print("ü§ñ OpenAI Request: \(prompt)")
}
```

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

### Track Usage

Monitor your OpenAI usage:

1. Visit [OpenAI Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
2. Set up billing alerts
3. Review monthly reports

### Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: Typically 2-5 seconds
- **Accuracy**: 80-95% confidence for common foods
- **User Satisfaction**: Track how often users accept AI suggestions

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Handling

- Meal descriptions are sent to OpenAI for processing
- No personal user information is included in requests
- OpenAI's data usage policy applies

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** in production
3. **Rotate keys regularly**
4. **Monitor usage** for unusual activity

### GDPR Compliance

- Inform users that meal descriptions are processed by OpenAI
- Provide opt-out options for AI features
- Include in your privacy policy

## üö¶ Production Deployment

### Environment Setup

```swift
// Production configuration
private init() {
    #if DEBUG
    self.apiKey = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "OPENAI_API_KEY") as? String ?? ""
    #else
    // Use Keychain or secure environment variable
    self.apiKey = KeychainHelper.getAPIKey() ?? ""
    #endif
}
```

### Error Handling

Implement comprehensive error handling:

- Network timeouts
- API rate limits
- Invalid responses
- Fallback to manual entry

### Caching

Consider caching common food analyses:

```swift
// Cache frequently analyzed foods
private var analysisCache: [String: MealAnalysis] = [:]
```

## üéâ Next Steps

### Enhanced Features

1. **Food Image Recognition**: Combine with Core ML
2. **Nutritionist Chat**: Interactive nutrition advice
3. **Recipe Generation**: Create recipes based on preferences
4. **Grocery Lists**: Generate shopping lists from meal plans
